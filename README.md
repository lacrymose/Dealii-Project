# Dealii-Project
Master's Project on Geometric multigrid preconditioners for the Poisson problem using the deal.II FEM librarys.

To apply geometric multigrid preconditioenrs to solve the (generalised) Poisson problem in 2D in the deal.II C++ library. The Kelly-based error indicator
will be used to perform h-adaptive refinement. The effect of different “smoothers” (Jacobi,Gauss-Seidel) are to be studied. The (positive) influence of a good preconditioner on
the iterative solvers (e.g. Conjugate Gradient) is to be examined.
